# Ice-Nucleation

Ice Nucleation Controller is a system used to perform high precision ice nucleation experiments. System temperature range is from +10°C to -30°C. A specified temperature gradient is held throughout experiments using a cooling circuit consisting of a closed water loop and a PID controlled pair of peltier elements. Temperatures are measured using a FLIR A655sc thermal camera and run-time calibrated using a thermistor in a fixed calibration cavity. Freezing temperatures for each sample are estimated using extracted temperature gradients and can be used for further processing.
